       " '  A city that not only has a long history of hosting Labour conferences, but also of inspirational Labour activists',\n",

       " ' She risked the sack to join the Shop Workers’ Union, after learning about it in a newspaper used to wrap up fish and chips, and was so effective at standing up for women shop workers, she became assistant general secretary before the age of 30',\n",
       " '\\n In that role she seconded the historic resolution at the Trades Union Congress of 1899  to set up the Labour Representation Committee so that working people would finally have representation in Parliament',\n",

       " '  Margaret Bondfield’s story is a reminder of the decisive role women have played in the Labour Party from its foundation, and that Labour has always been about making change  by working together and standing up for others',\n",
       " '\\n Conference, against all predictions in June we won the largest increase in the Labour vote since 1945 and achieved Labour’s best vote for a generation',\n",
       " ' It’s a result which has put the Tories on notice  and Labour on the threshold of power',\n",

       " '\\n At each other’s throats, squabbling and plotting, manoeuvring to bundle the Prime Minister out of Number Ten  and take her place  at the first opportunity  Instead of getting to grips with the momentous issues facing our country',\n",

       " '\\n Conference, there were two stars of our election campaign',\n",
       " ' The first was our Manifesto  that drew on the ideas of our members and trade unionists  and the hopes and aspirations of their communities and workplaces',\n",
       " '  And we were clear about how we would pay for it by asking the richest and the largest corporations to start paying their fair share',\n",
       " '\\n Not simply to redistribute within a system that isn’t delivering for most people  but to transform that system',\n",
       " ' So we set out  not only how we would protect public services but how we would rebuild and invest in our economy, with a publicly-owned engine of sustainable growth, driven by national and regional investment banks,  to generate good jobs and prosperity in every region and nation',\n",
       " '\\n Our Manifesto is the programme of a modern, progressive socialist party  that has rediscovered its roots and its purpose, bucking the trend across Europe',\n",

       " ' Our members, our supporters in the trade unions, our doorstep and social media campaigners',\n",
       " ' Young people sharing messages and stories on social media, hundreds of thousands organising online and on the ground  to outplay the Tories’ big money machine',\n",
       " '\\n Is it any wonder that here today in Brighton you represent the largest political party in western Europe, with nearly 600,000 members, alongside three million affiliated trade unionists, brimming with enthusiasm and confidence in the potential of our people',\n",

       " '  And let me say straight away',\n",
       " ' I’m awed and humbled by everything you have done, along with hundreds of thousands of others across the country, to take us to where we are today',\n",

       " ' Our election campaign gave people strength',\n",
       " ' It brought millions on to the electoral register  and inspired millions to go to vote for the first time',\n",
       " '\\n And Labour was the Party of unity, bringing generations and communities together, rather than pitting young and old against each other, as the Tories did',\n",
       " '  We will never seek to squeeze one generation to support another',\n",
       " '  Under Labour, people will win together',\n",
       " '\\n The result of our campaign confounded every expert and sceptic',\n",
       " '  I see John McDonnell said the ‘grey beards’ had got it all wrong',\n",
       " ' I’m not sure that’s entirely fair, John? We wiped out the Tory majority,  winning support in every social and age group  and gaining seats in every region and nation of the country',\n",

       " ' The Labour campaign machine is primed and ready to roll',\n",

       " ' I’m thinking of some of our more traditional media friends',\n",
       " ' They ran the campaign they always do under orders from their tax exile owners  to trash Labour at every turn',\n",
       " ' The day before the election one paper devoted fourteen pages to attacking the Labour Party',\n",

       " '\\n Never have so many trees died in vain',\n",
       " ' The British people saw right through it',\n",
       " ' So this is a message to the Daily Mail’s editor - next time, please could you make it 28 pages?\\n But there’s a serious message too, the campaign by the Tories and their loyal media was nasty and personal',\n",
       " '  It fuelled abuse online and no one was the target of that more than Diane Abbott',\n",
       " ' She has a decades-long record of campaigning for social justice and has suffered intolerable misogynistic and racist abuse',\n",
       " ' Faced with such an overwhelmingly hostile press and an army of social media trolls,it’s even more important that we stand',\n",
       " '\\n Yes we will disagree, but there can never be any excuse for any abuse of anybody',\n",
       " ' We settle our differences with democratic votes and unite around those decision',\n",
       " '\\n That is the Labour Party, here this week, and out in the communities EVERY week - diverse, welcoming, democratic  and ready to serve our country',\n",

       " '  As democratic socialists, we accept and respect the referendum result, but respect for a democratic decision  does not mean giving a green light to a recklesss Tory Brexit agenda  that would plunge Britain into a Trump-style race-to-the-bottom  in rights and corporate taxes',\n",

       " ' But manufacturing industries would go to the wall  taking skilled jobs with them our tax base would crumble  our public services would be slashed still further',\n",
       " '\\n We are now less than 18 months away from leaving the European Union',\n",
       " ' And so far, the Tory trio leading the talks have got nowhere  and agreed next to nothing',\n",

       " ' A cliff-edge Brexit is at risk of becoming a reality',\n",
       " ' That is why Labour has made clear that Britain should stay within the basic terms of the single market  and a customs union  for a limited transition period',\n",
       " ' It is welcome at least that Theresa May has belatedly accepted that',\n",
       " '\\n But beyond that transition, our task is a different one',\n",
       " ' It is to unite everyone in our country around a progressive vision of what Britain could be, but with a government that stands for the many not the few',\n",

       " ' Or a Labour Brexit that puts jobs first a Brexit for the many, one that guarantees unimpeded access to the single market  and establishes a new co-operative relationship with the EU',\n",
